## Loops

In python, there are two different types of loops: `while` and `for`. `While` loops continue to repeat as a boolean expression is evaluated to be true, whereas `for` loops iterate through an object, such as a list, string, or `range()`.

In Python, a for loop is used to iterate over a sequence of elements such as a list, tuple, or string. The syntax for a for loop in Python is as follows:

```python
for variable in sequence:
    # code block to be executed repeatedly
```

Here, `variable` is a new variable that takes on the value of each element in the `sequence` during each iteration of the loop. The `sequence` can be any iterable object such as a list, tuple, string, or even a dictionary.

For example, let's say we have a list of numbers and we want to print each number in the list using a for loop:

```python
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
for number in numbers:
    print(number)
```
Outputs:
```
1
2
3
4
5
```

We can also use the range() function to generate a sequence of numbers to iterate over:

```python
for i in range(5):
    print(i)
```

Output:
```
0
1
2
3
4
```

In addition, we can use the enumerate() function to iterate over a sequence of elements and their indices:

```python
fruits = ['apple', 'banana', 'orange']
for index, fruit in enumerate(fruits):
    print(index, fruit)
```

output:
```
0 apple
1 banana
2 orange
```

## Tasks
You should be only using for loops for these tasks.

1. Print the numbers from 0 to 20.
2. Print only the even numbers between 0 and 20
3. Calculate the sum of all the numbers from 0 to 100
4. Reverse a given string.
5. Print Pascal's triangle of 10 rows.

Use only while loops:
1. Write a program that generates a random number between 1 and 100 and asks the user to guess the number. If the user's guess is too high, the program should print "Too high" and if it's too low, the program should print "Too low". The program should continue prompting the user for guesses until they guess the correct number. Use the random module with `import random`.
2. Write a program that prompts the user to enter a series of numbers, terminated by a negative number. The program should then print out the average of the numbers entered, excluding the negative number.
