Welcome to the Advanced Coding Class - Python at Sydney Robotics Academy. This term we will be covering a range of topics with Python:
  - I/O operations, including from the terminal and filesystem.
  - Different datatypes, such as double, float, integer, char, string, etc.
  - Different methods of storing multiple pieces of data, such as lists.
  - Making our code more readable with functions.
  - Making webpages with HTML, CSS and Javascript.

Firstly, before we can start coding, we need to install some programs. Some of these programs will tell our computer how to understand our code, and others will help us write our programs.

We will be installing all of these programs from our local website: <http://apps.sydneyrobotics.com.au>
  1. Python 3.1x - This program will ensure that our computer can understand our code. After the file has been downloaded, open the file and follow the instructions.

  2. Visual Studio Code. - This is a simple code editor which has some useful features, including syntax highlighting. This means that our code will change colours depending of what each word does, and if there are any errors.

Once these two programs have been installed, please open VSCode and you will see options to change the theme. You can choose any theme you want.

Now that you have finished setting up VSCode, we can use the keyboard shortcut `CTRL/CMD-N` to create a new file, then we can save the new file with `CTRL/CMD-S`
