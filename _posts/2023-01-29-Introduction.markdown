Welcome to the Advanced Coding Class - Python at Sydney Robotics Academy. This term we will be covering a range of topics with Python:
  - I/O operations, including from the terminal and filesystem.
  - Different datatypes, such as double, float, integer, char, string, etc.
  - Different methods of storing multiple pieces of data, such as lists.
  - Making our code more readable with functions.
  - Making webpages with HTML, CSS and Javascript.

Firstly, before we can start coding, we need to install some programs. Some of these programs will tell our computer how to understand our code, and others will help us write our programs.

We will be installing all of these programs from our local website: <http://apps.sydneyrobotics.com.au>
  1. Python 3.1x - This program will ensure that our computer can understand our code. After the file has been downloaded, open the file and follow the instructions.

  2. Visual Studio Code. - This is a simple code editor which has some useful
     features, including syntax highlighting. This means that our code will 
     change colours depending of what each word does, and if there are any 
     errors.


Once these two programs have been installed, please open VSCode and you will
see options to change the theme. You can choose any theme you want.

Now that you have finished setting up VSCode, we can use the keyboard shortcut
CTRL/CMD-N to create a new file, then we can save the new file with 
CTRL/CMD-S



You’ll find this post in your `_posts` directory. Go ahead and edit it and re-build the site to see your changes. You can rebuild the site in many different ways, but the most common way is to run `jekyll serve`, which launches a web server and auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated.

Jekyll requires blog post files to be named according to the following format:

`YEAR-MONTH-DAY-title.MARKUP`

Where `YEAR` is a four-digit number, `MONTH` and `DAY` are both two-digit numbers, and `MARKUP` is the file extension representing the format used in the file. After that, include the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}

Check out the [Jekyll docs][jekyll-docs] for more info on how to get the most out of Jekyll. File all bugs/feature requests at [Jekyll’s GitHub repo][jekyll-gh]. If you have questions, you can ask them on [Jekyll Talk][jekyll-talk].
